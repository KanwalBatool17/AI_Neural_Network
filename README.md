# AI_Neural_Network
In this repository I am uploading all neural network programs in python language. Neural Network act as a Human Brain allow computer program to recognize the patterns and solve common problems in the World of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Data usually fed in these model to train them. Neural Network have further types: Convolution Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network. Simply is that a machine that train or update its self to do prediction. Neural Networks rely on data and work to improve accuracy over time. Neural Network is also known as Artificial Neural Network OR Simulated Neural Network and are the heart of Deep Learning Algorithms.
